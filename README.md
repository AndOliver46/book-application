# Project Description

This project is a demonstration of building microservices from scratch using Spring Cloud, Spring Boot, Java, and Docker. It accompanies the Udemy course "Microsservi√ßos do Zero com Spring Cloud, Spring Boot e Docker" instructed by Leandro Costa.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: A powerful framework for building Java-based microservices quickly and easily.
- **Spring Cloud**: Provides tools for building and managing distributed systems, including service discovery, configuration management, and more.
- **Java**: The programming language used for developing the microservices.
- **Docker**: Used for containerization, enabling easy deployment and scaling of microservices.
- **Feign**: A declarative web service client for simplifying HTTP API clients.
- **Eureka**: Service discovery and registration service provided by Spring Cloud for locating services.
- **Spring Cloud Load Balancer**: Used for load balancing services.
- **Spring Cloud Gateway**: API gateway for managing and routing requests.
- **Resilience4j**: Circuit breaker library for improving the fault tolerance of microservices.
- **Swagger OpenAPI**: Used for generating API documentation.
- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and delivery.
- **RESTful APIs**: Utilized for communication between microservices.
- **Linux**: Basic Linux knowledge is required for development and deployment.
- **SQL Databases**: Basic knowledge of SQL and relational databases is assumed.

## Project Structure

The project consists of multiple microservices, each focusing on specific functionality. The microservices communicate with each other through RESTful APIs and are orchestrated using Spring Cloud technologies. Docker is used for containerizing the microservices, enabling seamless deployment and scaling.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to each microservice directory.
3. Build each microservice using Maven.
4. Run each microservice using the provided Docker configuration.
5. Access the microservices through their respective endpoints.
